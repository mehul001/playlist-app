## Thoughts, Comments & Challenges/Successes

Challenges - Initially setting up the NgRx store as it's definitely been a while since I had to set one up from scratch, but once the main state was up and running, everything began to fell into place.

Successes - Setting up the basic structure of the app, components and getting the database loaded into the state. Also managed to have a login feature where I noticed there was a users object so now on the state we have an `authenticated` property which can help hide/show components based on that

Thoughts / Comments - Overall was a great task from start to end which covers most of the structure for any app from setting up the app, setting up the state, adding styles and basic "toast" notifications
